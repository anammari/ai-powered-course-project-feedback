### Avoid Negative tone
- Poor feedback example: You didnâ€™t follow the instructions.
- Improved feedback: It seems there was a misunderstanding of the instructions. The assignment asked for a time series analysis, but your report focuses on a cross-sectional analysis. Revisiting the guidelines and applying a time series approach could enhance your analysis.

### Avoid being too brief
- Poor feedback example: Needs more detail.
- Improved feedback: The section on model evaluation could be more detailed. For instance, you could include additional metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to provide a more comprehensive assessment of your model's performance.

### Avoid giving vague feedback
- Poor feedback example: Good job.
- Improved feedback: Good job on cleaning the dataset and handling missing values effectively. Your use of descriptive statistics to summarize the data provided clear insights.

### Avoid unconstructive criticism
- Poor feedback example: This needs a lot of work.
- Improved feedback: Your data visualization needs improvement. Consider using more appropriate chart types for the data you're presenting and ensure that your graphs have clear labels and legends.

### Avoid overly critical without positives
- Poor feedback example: Your coding is terrible and your analysis is unclear.
- Improved feedback: While your code runs without errors, there are several inefficiencies that need attention. Additionally, your analysis could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the correlation results. However, your choice of variables for the regression model was well thought out.

### Avoid non-specific guidance
- Poor feedback example: Improve your analysis.
- Improved feedback: To improve your analysis, consider including a deeper exploration of the outliers and their impact on the regression results. For example, in your scatter plot, highlight and explain the data points that deviate significantly from the trend line.

### Avoid feedback without direction
- Poor feedback example: This part is confusing.
- Improved feedback: The methodology section is a bit confusing because it jumps between different stages of data processing. Try to structure it chronologically, detailing each step of data cleaning, transformation and analysis in a logical sequence.
