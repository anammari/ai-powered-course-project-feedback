- [ ] **Pass**: Presents relevant charts to visualise data distributions in both the slide deck and the Notebook  
- [ ] **Fail**: Does not present visualisations in both the slide deck and Notebook, or The visualisations are not relevant or largely inaccurate  
#### **Part 3.2:** Explains data visualisations
- [ ] **Pass**: Explains the visualisations in the slide deck (e.g., what the distribution reveals about the problem at hand)  
- [ ] **Fail**: Does not provide explanations of the visualisations in the slide deck, or Explanations are superficial or unconnected to churn analysis  
#### **Part 3.3:** Provides an accurate correlation matrix
- [ ] **Pass**: Provides an accurate correlation matrix in the Notebook to show the relationship between different attributes  
- [ ] **Fail**: Does not generate a correlation matrix in the Notebook, or The correlation matrix is largely inaccurate  
#### **Part 3.4:** Explains the correlation matrix
- [ ] **Pass**: Explains the findings from the generated correlation matrix in the slide deck and what it means for churn  
- [ ] **Fail**: Does not explain the correlation matrix in the slide deck, or Provides no explanations as to what the correlation values mean for churn  
#### **Part 3.5:** Explains data quality issues
- [ ] **Pass**: Identifies and addresses relevant data quality issues in the slide deck  
- [ ] **Pass**: Demonstrates correct methodology (e.g., handling missing data and/ or outliers)  
- [ ] **Fail**: Does not address any data quality issues in the slide deck, or The issues are not relevant, or Notes issues but makes no attempt to resolve or explain them  

### **Part 4** 
#### **Part 4.1:** Formulates hypotheses
- [ ] **Pass**: Formulates appropriate hypotheses about customer churn in the slide deck  
- [ ] **Pass**: Aligns each hypothesis with the projectâ€™s overall business objectives  
- [ ] **Fail**: Does not formulate hypotheses, or The hypotheses are not relevant or overly vague  
#### **Part 4.2:** Evaluates hypotheses
- [ ] **Pass**: Applies and interprets how a relevant statistical significance test is used to evaluate hypotheses, including findings in the slide deck  
- [ ] **Fail**: Does not explain how the statistical significance test is used to evaluate the hypotheses in the slide deck, or The statistical test is not relevant or largely incorrect  
#### **Part 4.3:** Designs a reasonable controlled experiment
- [ ] **Pass**: Designs and presents a reasonable plan for a meaningful controlled experiment to reduce churn  
- [ ] **Pass**: Specifies a control group, treatment group, duration and relevant metrics  
- [ ] **Fail**: Does not include a plan for a controlled experiment to reduce churn, or The plan is not reasonable or overly vague, or is missing key specifications  

### **Part 5 - Final Deliverables**  
#### **Part 5.1:** Provides a slide deck
- [ ] **Pass**: Includes a PowerPoint slide deck with the required number of slides outlining the specified information for a non-technical audience  
- [ ] **Fail**: Does not provide a PowerPoint slide deck, or The slide deck significantly exceeds the required number of slides, or The slide deck does not sufficiently adapt the findings for a non-technical audience  
#### **Part 5.2:** Provides a Python Notebook
- [ ] **Pass**: Provides a Python Jupyter Notebook with evidence of data manipulation, statistical analysis and data visualisation work  
- [ ] **Fail**: Does not provide a Notebook, or The Notebook does not show data manipulation, or The Notebook does not include statistical analysis, or The Notebook does not include data visualisations
